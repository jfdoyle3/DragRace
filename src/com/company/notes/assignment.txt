Completed/Improve       The objective of this assignment is to create an application
                        that allows a user to select at minimum a vehicle and an engine type.
                        Next the system should show distance left to travel and the user has at least three options:


Completed               accelerate
Completed               coast
Completed               decelerate


Completed               - accelerate should raise the vehicles speed by (recommended) the engines' acceleration rate until the vehicle reaches max speed.
Completed/Improve       - coast should maintain the vehicles current speed or if implemented apply some sort of reduction due to either
                          friction, wind resistance, vehicle weight etc.
Completed/Improve       - decelerate should reduce the vehicles speed by the (recommended) vehicles brake rate (unless a tire/breaks class is implemented)


Completed               no matter what option is selected a single Tick of time should pass where the vehicles current speed
                        is added to its position the speed is adjusted by the selected option.
                        Then the options are given again.


TODO    application should finish once the user gets the vehicle to travel the given distance and comes to a stop
    (a tick passes where the location of the car does not change) should display the amount of ticks it took.


            be creative on this I'm giving very little information to see if you can build something from almost no information.
            Ask for help when stuck and take the needed time to plan.

            Car/Vehicle can have no engine in it.
            you can add an engine later.
